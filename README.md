## Briefly about myself:

#### Greetings, my friend! My name is *Aktan*, I truly believe that a truly professional and high-quality programmer - must first of all be an extremely creative and versatile person who loves his profession and enjoys creating something beautiful. The world is beautiful and it becomes even better when I make projects that improve it and help people

> "I've missed more than 9000 shots in my career. I've lost almost 300 games. Twenty six times I've been trusted to take the game-winning shot and missed. I've failed over and over and over again in my life. And that is why I succeed." - **Michael Jordan**
