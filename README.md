## Briefly about myself:

#### Greetings, my friend! My name is *Aktan*, I truly believe that a truly professional and high-quality programmer - must first of all be an extremely creative and versatile person who loves his profession and enjoys creating something beautiful. The world is beautiful and it becomes even better when I make projects that improve it and help people
